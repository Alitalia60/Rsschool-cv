### About myself ###
I am an entrepreneur. my work is always close to computers and programming. I have no experience in modern IT although my experience in programming such as 1C Enterprise is long.

Here is some code example from Node.js

```js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const userRouter = require('./resources/users/user.router');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.originalUrl === '/') res.send('Service is running!';
  next();
});
app.use('/users', userRouter);
module.exports = app;
}
```

and task from Codewars

```js
var countBits = function(n) {
  // Program Me
      let res = 0;
    let binaryN = n.toString(2)
        // console.log(binaryN);
    for (let index = 0; index < binaryN.length; index++) {
        res += Number(binaryN[index])
    }
    return res
};
```
I like to learn everything new in programming.
Now, I continue to study HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, TypeScript and a lot other usefull and interesting things at school.
